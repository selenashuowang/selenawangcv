I am interested in developing easily accessible softwares for fitting state-of-art statistical models.

## jlsm
I developed a novel Variational Bayesian Expectation-Maximization algorithm for estimating Euclidean latent space models for bipartite networks as well as joint unipartite and bipartite networks. The algorithm accommodates large-scale datasets (over 100,000 data points) and is documented in the jlsm package, which is freely available on CRAN and has several modeling approaches. The R codes can be found in the github page.

## jnirt
I am interested in developmenting a R package for joint network and item response models. A JNIRT model can be used for estimating and testing dependencies between and within social networks and item responses.

## nres
I am interested in developmenting a R package for estimating the effects of external stress on a network, network resilience.
