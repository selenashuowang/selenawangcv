I am interested in teaching introductory statistics sequence, such as introduction to statistics, regression models, theory of linear models, and advanced quantitative courses, such as measurement theory, factor analysis, item response theory, and covariance structure models. Additional courses or seminars that I would be interested in teaching include network analysis, courses at the intersection of statistics and psychometrics, and statistical computing in R (introductory and advanced).
