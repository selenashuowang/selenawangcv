    I am a quantitative methodologist with a focus on interdisciplinary research. My doctoral studies are in quantitative psychology with an emphasis on integrating network science with psychometric frameworks. I focused on social network analysis while completing my M.Sc.in Statistics, and on psychometric principles and models during my Ph.D. in quantitative psychology. I develop statistical models for high-dimensional networks, multivariate datasets, and Big Data online networks and address research questions across multiple disciplines with focuses in psychology, education and political science.
