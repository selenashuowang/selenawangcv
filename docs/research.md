I am a quantitative methodologist with a focus on interdisciplinary research. Here, I describe my methodology works in three main domains. 

## Networks-related topics
Networks are datasets consisting of relationships or edges among a group of entities. Networks are distinct from other forms of data due to their complex dependence structures. I am interested in modeling dependencies in a network using latent variables. More specifically, I am interested in three lines of research: (1) latent space models and latent factor models, their properties and applications, (2) modeling processes occurring in networks such as the resilience and adaptation of networks in the face of external stress, and (3) the integration of network models with psychometric latent variable models such as item response models and factor models. 

## Psychometrics-related Topics

### Psychometric Principles & Measurement
I am interested in the relationship between measurement and experimental studies. I focuse on understanding the significance of reliability coefficient in modern-day behavioral research. The goal of this research is to clarify for the broad audience of behaviral scientists whether and how reliability coefficient is important under what circumstances.

### Latent variable models
I am also interested in item response theory (IRT) models and factor analysis (FA). I am interested in improper solutions (negative variance estimates, Heywood cases), convergence issues, and outlying estimates in factor analytic models. The problem can be cast in item response theory frameworks as the parameters of the two models are related. The goal of this research is to understand Heywood cases and provide pratical guidelines for countering estimation issues in substantive research. 

## Data science & machine learning algorithms
I am interested in the difference between two statistical philosophies, prediction vs. inference. I am interested in answering the question of whether the often-labelled pro-prediction regression weights are legitimate alternatives for psychologists whose main interest lies in building explanatory models identifying meaningful contributors of psychological phenomena. I am interested in applying machine learning algorithmns such as the classification and regression trees (CART) to identify optimal statistical frameworks in combinations of simulaton design factors and evaluation criteria. The goal of this research is to identify the best MLR estimators in the context of prediction vs. inference.
